<p>This article contains a list of useful terminal commands and explanations of what they do and why. I&#39;ll continually add to this list as I discover more neat terminal tricks.</p><br><h3>Exclude SVN and GIT Files While Backing Up a Directory</h3><p>If you&#39;re like me, you have quite  a few projects that use a mix of SVN and GIT version control systems. You may want to exclude all those hidden SVN and GIT files from your backup:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">sudo tar --exclude-vcs -zcvf ./backup.tar.gz /path/to/projects/directory</pre><br><h3>Output Result of a Terminal Command to a FIle</h3><p>Sometimes when using terminal, a command will generate such a large amount of output that it gets cut-off towards the beginning. The way to view the full output is by writing it to a file:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">cd ~/<br>ls -l &gt; output.txt</pre><p>Now if you open output.txt in <i>gedit</i> you should see a list of all the visible files and directories within the current user&#39;s home directory.</p><br><h3>Limit Download Speed for Large File Downloads</h3><p>If you&#39;ve ever needed to download a very large file, but didn&#39;t want to completely tie up your internet connection&#39;s bandwidth, you&#39;re going to love this:</p><pre class="code" data-type="code">cd ~/Downloads<br>wget --limit-rate=500k http://url-of-file-to-download</pre><p><a href="http://manpages.ubuntu.com/manpages/precise/man1/wget.1.html">wget</a> does a GET request to a specified URL. The <i>--limit-rate</i> option sets a maximum download speed for this download.</p>
