<p>So you have some bitcoins that you want to take &quot;offline&quot;, but aren&#39;t sure of how to do that or what that even means. Not a problem! This tutorial will guide you through the process of creating a secure, offline wallet to which you can send and safely store your bitcoins.</p>


<h3>Step 1: Download Ubuntu</h3>

<p>If you are already familiar with Linux and feel like using a different flavor than Ubuntu, feel free to do so. Ubuntu is recommended in this tutorial because it is probably the most accessible for newbies.</p>

<p>You can download the latest release of Ubuntu <a href="http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop">here</a>. You will be downloading an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_image">ISO</a> file, which is an archive of an optical disc. You could use this file to create a CD/DVD, or there are programs that can directly mount an ISO as if it were a physical CD/DVD in your computer&#39;s CD/DVD drive.</p>

<p>The download may take a while, so you can move on to the next step while it is downloading.</p>


<h3>Step 2: Verify the Ubuntu ISO</h3>

<p>After you have finished downloading the Ubuntu ISO, you&#39;ll want to verify it by comparing its md5 hash to the one provided to you on the Ubuntu website; you can view the <a href="https://help.ubuntu.com/community/UbuntuHashes">list of hashes here</a>. Find the hash that corresponds to the ISO that you downloaded earlier. These md5 hashes are 32 character length strings of text that were created by passing the contents of each ISO into the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MD5">md5 hashing algorithm</a>. If you give the md5 algorithm the exact same input data more than once, it will output the exact same 32 character string every time. This is important because this is how you can be sure that the ISO you downloaded has not been tampered with or corrupted in some way.</p>


<h4>For Windows Users</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re on a Windows machine, you can use <a href="http://winmd5.com/">winmd5</a> to verify the ISO&#39;s md5 hash. It provides a graphical interface for you, so you don&#39;t even need to use your command prompt.</p>

<p>Download the winmd5 program, then run it. Select the ISO file you downloaded earlier. Then, enter the md5 hash provided to you from the Ubuntu website in the bottom text field. After the hash has been computed for the ISO file, push the verify button to compare them. If they match, congratulations! You&#39;ve just successfully verified the ISO file. You can now move on to the next step.</p>


<h4>For Linux Users</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re using some flavor of Linux, you can use the <span class="code">md5sum</span> program to check the md5 hash of the ISO. Navigate to the directory in which you stored the ISO, then run the following command in your terminal:</p>
<pre class="code">
md5sum ubuntu-14.04-desktop-amd64.iso
</pre>
<p>The name of the ISO file may be different, so just replace the one above with the file name of the ISO you downloaded earlier.</p>
<p>This may take a little bit of time to process, depending upon the speed of your computer.</p>

<p>Once you&#39;ve created an md5 hash from the contents of the ISO, compare it to the one you downloaded from the Ubuntu website. If they match, congratulations! You&#39;ve just successfully verified the ISO file. You can now move on to the next step.</p>


<h3>Step 3: Create a Bootable USB Flash Drive</h3>

<p>Download <a href="http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/">UNetbootin</a> for your operating system. This program will allow you to create a bootable USB flash drive from the ISO you downloaded earlier.</p>

	</div>
</div>

<p>Before you can create your bootloader, you&#39;ll need to have a USB flash drive (with at least 2GB of space) available. Make sure the drive is formatted as FAT32.</p>

<p>Select &quot;Diskimage&quot; and browse to select the ISO file you downloaded previously. Then select the USB flash drive to which the bootloader will be installed. Finally click the &quot;OK&quot; button to begin the creation of your bootloader. This may take a few minutes.</p>

<p>If you have trouble with this step, you can <a href="http://www.howtogeek.com/howto/13379/create-a-bootable-ubuntu-9.10-usb-flash-drive/">this tutorial</a> which contains additional information about creating bootable USB flash drives.</p>


<h3>Step 4: Get the Bitcoin Wallet Software</h3>

<p>Download the <a href="https://bitcoin.org/en/download">bitcoin wallet software</a> for Linux; this will be a <i>.tar.gz</i> file. Once that&#39;s done downloading, copy it to the flash drive.</p>


<h3>Step 5: Disconnect Your Machine From the Internet</h3>

<p>Un-plug your ethernet cable, if there is one.</p>

<p>Now you&#39;ll want to disable your wireless adapter. To do this, first restart your computer, but before it boots into your regular, installed operating system, you&#39;ll need to open the BIOS menu. Usually this requires you to press the <i>F2</i> key early on in the boot process. The key to start the BIOS menu may be different for your hardware. Watch carefully when your computer is booting up for instructions for how to get to the BIOS menu.</p>

			<img src="/images/uploads/bios-menu-instructions-screenshot.jpg" alt="">
		</a>
		<p class="caption"></p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Once you&#39;re in the BIOS menu, navigate through the different sub-menus until you find a reference to your wireless adapter. Disable the wireless adapter.</p>

			<img src="/images/uploads/bios-menu-wireless-adapter-screenshot.jpg" alt="">
		</a>
		<p class="caption"></p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Do <strong>not</strong> exit the BIOS just yet! You will need to do one more thing in the BIOS in the next step.</p>


<h3>Step 6: Adjust the Boot Order</h3>

<p>In order for your machine to boot up using the bootloader installed on the flash drive, you&#39;ll need to move the USB media above your primary storage device in the boot order in the BIOS. To do this, navigate to the &quot;Boot Order&quot; sub-menu in the BIOS. Then move the USB media up in the boot order until it is above your primary storage device (which is usually a HDD or SSD).</p>

<p>Once that&#39;s done, you can &quot;Save &amp; Exit&quot; from the BIOS.</p>


<h3>Step 7: Booting into Ubuntu</h3>

<p>With the flash drive still plugged into one of your machine's USB ports, your machine should now automatically boot into the Ubuntu OS that is installed on the flash drive. If it didn't, you'll want to look back over the last few steps to verify you did everything correctly.</p>

<p>Once Ubuntu has started, you'll want to verify that your machine is in fact disconnected from the internet. Open Firefox and try to go to some website. You'll want to see some kind of error page saying that you're not currently online.</p>

<div class="center">
	<div class="image">
		<a href="/images/uploads/firefox-not-online-screenshot.jpg" title="Screenshot of Firefox not online error page">
			<img src="/images/uploads/firefox-not-online-screenshot.jpg" alt="">
		</a>
		<p class="caption"></p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>If you are able to access the internet, go back to step 5 and make sure you've done everything correctly. If you are not able to access the internet, move on to the next step.</p>


<h3>Step 8: Create an Encrypted Bitcoin Wallet</h3>

<p>First, you'll need to retrieve the bitcoin wallet software from the flash drive. Open the flash drive up in nautilus (the Ubuntu file manager). Copy the bitcoin <i>.tar.gz</i> file to the desktop. Right click the archive and then &quot;Extract..&quot;. Navigate into the folder that this created. Go to <i>bin</i> then <i>64</i>. Now you will see several different binary files. Double click <i>bitcoin-qt</i>. This is the graphical interface for the bitcoin wallet software.</p>

<div class="center">
	<div class="image">
		<a href="/images/uploads/bitcoin-qt-screenshot.jpg" title="Screenshot of bitcoin-qt">
			<img src="/images/uploads/bitcoin-qt-screenshot.jpg" alt="">
		</a>
		<p class="caption"></p>
	</div>
</div>

<p>Encrypt the wallet using a strong password (<i>Settings</i> -> <i>Encrypt wallet</i>). A strong password should consist of alphanumeric characters as well as some non-alphanumeric characters, and it should be at least 20 characters long. This password should be unique. Do <strong>not</strong> use this password for anything else! Do <strong>not</strong> save this password to the flash drive or to any electronic device that is not encrypted. You may want to write the password down on a piece of paper and store it in a safety deposit box.</p>


<h3>Step 10: Make Note of Receiving Addresses</h3>

<p>From within the bitcoin-qt client, you'll want to copy at least a few different public (receiving) bitcoin addresses for your wallet. Paste these addresses into a text document on the flash drive. These addresses will allow you to send bitcoins to this wallet.</p>


<h3>Step 9: Backup the Encrypted Wallet File</h3>

<p>Open the file manager and navigate to the home directory. Press <i>Ctrl+H</i> to show hidden files and directories. Open the <i>.bitcoin</i> directory. Copy the <i>wallet.dat</i> file to the flash drive.</p>

<p>This is your encrypted wallet file. You should make several backups of this file and preferably store them in multiple different physical locations. If you lose this file (and all copies of it) you will not be able to access the wallet anymore!</p>


<h3>Step 11: Clean Up</h3>

<p>Shut down your machine and make sure that it is completely powered off. If it's a laptop, take the battery out. Leave the machine sitting like this for at least a minute.</p>

<p>Now you should be able to re-enable your wireless adapter and/or plug the ethernet cable back in, to allow your machine to connect to the internet once again.</p>


<h3>Step 12: Sending Bitcoins to the Encrypted Wallet</h3>

<p>This step may vary, depending upon where you currently have your bitcoins stored.


<h4>Third-Party Wallet Services</h4>

<p>If your bitcoins currently live in a web wallet or other third-party wallet service, simply login to your account with that service and send a very small amount of bitcoin to one of the receiving addresses for the encrypted wallet. You only want to send a small amount at this stage because you want to first verify that you didn't make a mistake while creating the encrypted wallet.</p>

<p>Check the receiving address at <a href="https://blockexplorer.com/">Block Explorer</a> periodically until you see that the bitcoins have arrived.</p>


<h4>Other Wallet Software</h4>

<p>If you are currently using some other wallet software (Electrum, Armory, etc.) to store your bitcoins, this will be a bit more complicated. From the machine on which your current wallet is located, copy the <i>wallet.dat</i> file to the flash drive. Be sure not to overwrite the <i>wallet.dat</i> file already there (the one for your new wallet).</p>

<p>Now boot into Ubuntu on the flash drive again. Once Ubuntu has started, you'll need to install the wallet software that contained your old wallet. Once you're done installing that software, navigate to the hidden <i>.bitcoin</i> folder in your the home directory. Replace the <i>wallet.dat</i> found here with the one from your old wallet.</p>

<p>Start the wallet software. Your should now have access to your old wallet. Send a very small amount of bitcoins to one of the receiving addresses for your new wallet.</p>

<p>Check the receiving address at <a href="https://blockexplorer.com/">Block Explorer</a> periodically until you see that the bitcoins have arrived.</p>


<h3>Step 13: Wrap Up</h3>

<p>To be on the safe side, after having sent a small amount of bitcoins to your new wallet, you'll want to try sending a small amount of bitcoins interally to another receiving address of the new wallet. This will ensure that you have control of those bitcoins within the new wallet.</p>

<p>After all that, you can send the rest of your bitcoins to the new wallet. And, if you want to be on the extra safe side, you may want to create several different bitcoin wallets in the same way described in this tutorial. This will allow you to diversify your bitcoin holdings; so that even if one of the wallets is somehow compromised, you won't lose all of your bitcoins.</p>

<p>Keep the flash drive handy. You'll need it whenever you want to securely send bitcoins from your new wallet(s).</p>
